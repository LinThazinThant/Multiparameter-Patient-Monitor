We need to grab the sensor (DS18B20). Here we can clearly see that in the first row leds (representing Temperature), the green lights up, meaning that the temperature  is normal between 34-37°C.

## MAX30100 (SpO2 & Heart rate Sensor)

We need to place our finger on the sensor (MAX30100). One thing to make sure is that the red light of sensor should be directly under our finger (as shown in the figure). Here we can clearly see that in the second and third rows of leds (second row reprsents SpO2, third row represents Heart rate), the green leds light up meaning that SpO2 and heart rate are normal within range ≥ 95% and 60-120 bpm, respectively.

We need to place the sensor (FSR402) as in Figure 2. One thing to make sure is that the belt must be tight enough to measure correct respiratory rate. Here we can clearly see that in the last row leds (representing Respiratory rate), the green lights up, meaning that the respiratory rate  is normal between 12-15 breaths/minute.

**Note:** I measured one sensor at a time. So only respective row of led lights up green while other rows light up red.
